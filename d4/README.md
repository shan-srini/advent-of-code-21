# Advent of code day 4

### Notes
- I initially implemented in Python and decided I didn't like it for this!
  - Maybe something like Kotlin would've been nice for this? Java is probably best
    but too much overhead for doing this quickly
  - I've been using safe navigation in javascript and ruby so much, I wish Python had it
